# color-names-generator
Generator for color names to name hex pairs pairs.
The use case is really not all that fancy, I just needed to create a color picker but instead of using hex values or a color wheel it needed to use the actual color names. So this is a small utility that just pulls colors from [source](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) parses them into the required format then generates a file in the language of choices ( Js and Dart ).
For now just doing web colors because they cover alot. May add more souces if the need arises.
## Usage
